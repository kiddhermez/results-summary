## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - CSS framework
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - Animation Library

### What I learned

I use this project to learn about react and framer motion animations, using the _motion_ component and applying the properties _initial_, _animate_, _transition_, etc.

```html
<motion.div initial={{ x: 400 }} animate={{ x: 0 }} transition={{ delay: delay }}>
            ...
</motion.div>
```

with that, I improve my use of Tailwind CSS classes

```html
<section className="flex flex-col gap-5 p-10 md:w-[50%]"></section>
```

### Continued development

I want continue improving my skills in the tecnologies that I was using in this project
